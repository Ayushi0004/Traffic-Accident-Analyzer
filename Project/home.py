st.markdown("<p style='color:white;'>Road accidents in India can be categorized into several main types. Vehicle-related accidents involve collisions between various vehicle types, such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles. Pedestrian-related accidents involve pedestrians who either collide with vehicles or experience falls due to inadequate road infrastructure. Infrastructure-related accidents result from poor road conditions, including potholes, uneven surfaces, and insufficient lighting. Weather-related accidents are caused by adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, or snow, which impair visibility and affect vehicle control. Lastly, human error-related accidents occur due to human factors such as reckless driving, speeding, driving under the influence, or driver fatigue.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
st.markdown("<p style='color:white;'>By examining and categorizing road accidents based on these factors, we can identify primary causes and implement effective prevention strategies. These may include infrastructure improvements, enhancing public awareness of traffic regulations, and enforcing stricter penalties for traffic violations. </p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
